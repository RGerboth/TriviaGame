Test your basic knowledge of Monty Python's Quest for the Holy Grail.

## Overview
This is another timing exercise built around the setInterval function. The player has 10 seconds to answer each question, or face the Black Best of Argh. At the end of the game the total guessed correctly, total guessed incorrectly and total not guessed at all are displayed and the user may play again. DOM manipulation is handled with jQuery. 

There are only five questions in this version. Also, be aware that there are some sound effects.
